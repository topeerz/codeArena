    // TODO: vm doesn't work after screen reload by swiftUI. Seems VM are re-created but old ones are used by bindings?
    // How does it work and if I actually want screen to be "rested" or not? I think model should be preserved in this case (I am but treutrning to screen) so if I want clean state I should manually reset model (and hence view model).
    // It would seem that even when using observation framework @State (or it's properties) must _NOT_ be modifiled outside of swiftui.

        // GOTHA!: accessing @StateObject in init will cause creation of new vm each time (`Accessing StateObject's object without being installed on a View. This will create a new instance each time.`). Using @ObservedObject or @State doesn't cause this issue howeveer when @State is used for model (and Observation framework is in use) updating model properties outside of swiftui (like in interactor) won't take effect. (because new interactor + model are created here, but old ones are used in swiftui hierarchy).
        // In other words: we must use ObservedObject for vm - even though it will trigger updates on any property change if should be ok as this is VM ... This though means we are back to resource releasing problems when it comes to VM.
        // OR we must use something with @State so swiftui manage lifecycle for us. So either we need to have all in model or we have @State interactor - even though it has no states ...

        // GOTHA!: can't initialize @State in init. It just fails silently (no warnings) - this is beacuse @State is just reference to storage maintained by swiftui
